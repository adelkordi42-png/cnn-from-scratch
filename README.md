# CNN from Scratch

Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network components using only NumPy.

## Implemented

- **Zero padding** - Pad images for convolution
- **Convolution forward** - Apply filters to extract features
- **Convolution backward** - Backpropagate gradients through conv layers
- **Pooling** - Max and average pooling for downsampling

## Skills

- CNN architecture understanding
- Backpropagation in convolution layers
- NumPy vectorization
- Matrix operations
